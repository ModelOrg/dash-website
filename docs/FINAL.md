Appendix A: Alternative Architectures Considered
Why Not Streamlit?

Less flexible for complex layouts
Harder to share components across pages
Reloads entire app on interaction

Why Not Pure React?

Steeper learning curve for Python devs
Requires JavaScript knowledge
More build tooling complexity

Why Not Traditional SQL Database Only?

Cost scales poorly with data volume
Query performance degrades with large tables
Parquet + DuckDB provides better performance per dollar
